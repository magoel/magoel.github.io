Welcome to my corner of the internet!

After nearly two decades of building software — from EDA simulators to Microsoft Office — I've finally decided to start writing about the things I've learned along the way.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover topics close to my heart:

- **Performance Engineering**: The art and science of making software fast
- **Systems Architecture**: Designing systems that scale and endure
- **C++ Deep Dives**: Modern C++ patterns, gotchas, and best practices
- **Developer Productivity**: Tools and workflows that make us more effective
- **Career Reflections**: Lessons from 19+ years in the industry

## Why Now?

I've always believed in learning by doing and teaching by sharing. Writing forces clarity of thought, and I hope these posts will be useful to others walking similar paths.

Stay tuned for more. Let's build something magnificent together.
